    Thanks for the contribution!
    I have applied any labels matching special text in your title and description.

    Please review the labels and make any necessary changes.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  ':bug: bug':
    include:
      - '\bbug\b:'
  ':star2: feature':
    include:
      - '\bfeature\b:'
  ':blue_book: documentation':
    include:
      - '\bdocs\b:'
  ':broom: chore':
    include:
      - '\bchore\b:'
  ':framed_picture: design':
